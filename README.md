# Electronic Journal
## Project description

Web application "Electronic Journal", made in Laravel, is intended for teachers at the school for enrolling classes and grading students and for parents to review their children's grades.
The administrator can see all classes, subjects, grades, teachers. He enters users, generates their usernames and initial passwords, he can enter new courses and subjects. He can also enrole students, assign students to classes, classes to teachers, assign subjects to them. He can change and delete all of the above.
The principal has an overview of all students, subjects, classes, teachers and the function of changing the incorrectly entered grade that is forwarded by the teacher.
The teacher sees only his subjects and classes on those subjects. He enters grades, notes, concludes grades, enters classes and absences, and can send a request to change an incorrectly entered grade.
In addition to all the above, the class teacher also administers his class. He can enter students, assign subjects to them, regulate absences, see all their grades. He also adds contacts for students (parents) and creates their accounts.
A parent can access their account and review their child's grades and absences.
Also, all users can update their profile (username, password and image).
